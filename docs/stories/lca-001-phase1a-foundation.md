# Story: LCA-001 - Phase 1A Foundation

## Story Information
- **Project ID**: LCA-001
- **Epic**: LCAgents Phase 1 Implementation
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Size**: Large (8 weeks)
- **Status**: Draft

## Story
As a development team, we need to build the foundational infrastructure for LCAgents so that we can distribute a working NPX package that installs BMAD-Core compatible agent resources in any project repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: NPX Installation System
- [ ] Users can run `npx @lendingclub/lcagents init` to install LCAgents
- [ ] Installation creates complete `.lcagents/` directory structure
- [ ] Installation adds appropriate entries to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Installation creates `.lcagents-config.json` with default configuration
- [ ] Installation creates `README-lcagents.md` with usage instructions
- [ ] Installation creates `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot integration

### AC2: Basic Resource Distribution
- [ ] Installation copies all 63+ BMAD-Core files to appropriate `.lcagents/` subdirectories
- [ ] All 11 agent files are distributed to `.lcagents/agents/`
- [ ] All 24 task files are distributed to `.lcagents/tasks/`
- [ ] All 13 template files are distributed to `.lcagents/templates/`
- [ ] All 6 checklist files are distributed to `.lcagents/checklists/`
- [ ] All 6 data files are distributed to `.lcagents/data/`
- [ ] All 2 utility files are distributed to `.lcagents/utils/`
- [ ] All 6 workflow files are distributed to `.lcagents/workflows/`
- [ ] All 4 agent team files are distributed to `.lcagents/agent-teams/`

### AC3: Simple Resource Resolution
- [ ] Basic file resolution system can locate files by type and name
- [ ] Resource resolver can find files using `.lcagents/{type}/{name}` pattern
- [ ] System validates that all expected files exist after installation
- [ ] Clear error messages when files are missing or inaccessible
- [ ] File permissions are set correctly for read/write operations

### AC4: Basic Agent Loading
- [ ] System can parse agent YAML from markdown files
- [ ] Agent definitions are loaded with persona, commands, and dependencies
- [ ] Basic validation ensures agent files have required structure
- [ ] System can list available agents
- [ ] Agent dependency lists are parsed and validated (without execution)

### AC5: Uninstallation System
- [ ] Users can run `npx @lendingclub/lcagents uninstall` to remove LCAgents
- [ ] Uninstallation removes `.lcagents/` directory
- [ ] Uninstallation removes `.lcagents-config.json`
- [ ] Uninstallation removes `README-lcagents.md`
- [ ] Uninstallation cleans up `.gitignore` entries
- [ ] Uninstallation preserves `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (user decision)

- [ ] Add command-line help and validation

### Task 4: Resource Resolution System
**Estimate: 5 days**

- [ ] Implement path resolution for all resource types
- [ ] Add file existence and accessibility validation
- [ ] Create error handling for missing resources
- [ ] Add logging for resource operations
- [ ] Create unit tests for resource resolution

### Task 5: Agent Loading System
**Estimate: 8 days**
- [ ] Create YAML parser for agent markdown files
- [ ] Implement `AgentDefinition` interface and parsing
- [ ] Create agent validation (required fields, structure)
- [ ] Implement dependency parsing and validation
- [ ] Create agent registry and loading system
- [ ] Add error handling for malformed agent files

### Task 6: Configuration Management
**Estimate: 4 days**
- [ ] Design configuration schema for `.lcagents-config.json`
- [ ] Implement configuration loading and validation
- [ ] Create default configuration generation
- [ ] Add configuration validation and error reporting
- [ ] Create configuration update/merge functionality
- [ ] Add configuration backup/restore

### Task 7: GitHub Integration Preparation
**Estimate: 3 days**
- [ ] Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` template
- [ ] Research GitHub Copilot API integration requirements
- [ ] Design agent activation command structure
- [ ] Create placeholder for future GitHub integration
- [ ] Document GitHub integration architecture
- [ ] Prepare integration test framework

### Task 8: Testing and Validation
**Estimate: 5 days**
- [ ] Create unit tests for all core modules
- [ ] Create integration tests for installation/uninstallation
- [ ] Test resource distribution and validation
- [ ] Test agent loading and parsing
- [ ] Create end-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Validate against multiple project types

### File Copying Strategy
- Use streaming for large files
- Validate checksums after copying
- Preserve file permissions
- Handle concurrent access safely
- Provide progress feedback for large operations

### Resource Validation
- Validate YAML syntax in agent files
- Check required fields in all resources
- Verify file references between resources
- Ensure template schema compliance
- Validate workflow definitions

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for common failures
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation when possible
- Rollback capability for failed installations
- Comprehensive error codes and documentation

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] ResourceResolver file lookup functionality
- [ ] AgentLoader YAML parsing and validation
- [ ] ConfigManager configuration handling
- [ ] FileManager operations (copy, delete, validate)
- [ ] CLI command parsing and execution

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full installation in empty project
- [ ] Installation in project with existing files
- [ ] Uninstallation with complete cleanup
- [ ] Resource validation after installation
- [ ] Agent loading from installed files

### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Fresh project initialization
- [ ] Repeated install/uninstall cycles
- [ ] Installation with permission issues
- [ ] Installation with insufficient disk space
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Unit test coverage >90%
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] End-to-end tests passing
- [ ] Documentation completed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] NPM package published to test registry
- [ ] Manual testing completed on multiple projects
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within acceptable limits

## Dependencies
- Node.js 16+ runtime
- NPM package registry access
- File system permissions for target projects
- Git repository for version control
- TypeScript compilation toolchain

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: File permission issues on target systems
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive permission checking and clear error messages
- **Risk**: Large package size due to 63+ resource files
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize file packaging and consider compression
- **Risk**: Platform compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation**: Test on multiple operating systems
- **Risk**: Existing file conflicts during installation
  - **Mitigation**: Conflict detection and user prompting

## Success Metrics
- Installation completes successfully in <30 seconds
- Package size remains under 5MB
- Installation works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Zero data loss during uninstallation
- Resource validation catches >95% of malformed files
