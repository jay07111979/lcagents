# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## User-Friendly Agent CRUD Interface for LCAgents

**Document Version:** 1.2  
**Created:** September 11, 2025  
**Last Updated:** September 11, 2025  
**Author:** Product Manager Agent  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Currently, LCAgents requires technical expertise to create or customize agents. Users must manually edit YAML/Markdown files, understand layered architecture, and possess knowledge of agent definition structures. This creates a significant barrier for non-technical team members (PMs, business analysts, domain experts) who want to create specialized agents for their workflows.

### Solution Overview
Implement an intelligent, wizard-based CLI interface that enables any user to create, modify, and manage agents through guided conversations. The system will handle all technical complexity behind the scenes while providing smart suggestions, validation, and conflict resolution.

### Business Impact
- **Democratizes agent creation** - Non-technical users can create specialized agents
- **Accelerates adoption** - Reduces setup time from hours to minutes
- **Improves user experience** - Intuitive interface vs. technical file editing
- **Increases platform value** - More agents = more diverse use cases
- **Reduces support burden** - Self-service agent management
- **Enables comprehensive customization** - Full CRUD operations for all agent resources
- **Streamlines team workflows** - Multi-agent orchestration and dependencies

### Version 1.2 Updates
- Added comprehensive resource management (Phase 6 & 7)
- Expanded CLI commands for checklists, data, tasks, workflows, utils
- Enhanced multi-agent workflow orchestration
- Added resource dependency management
- Included guided creation for all BMad-core resource types
