### Safe Modification Flow
```
🔧 Modify Agent: pm (Product Manager)

⚠️  You're modifying a CORE agent. Changes will be saved as overrides in CUSTOM layer.
✅ Original agent will remain intact and can be restored.

Current capabilities:
1. Create requirements documents  
2. Plan features and roadmaps
3. Write user stories
4. Manage stakeholder communication

What would you like to modify?
  1) Add new capabilities
  2) Add custom commands with conflict checking ✅
  3) Change communication style  
  4) Add specialized knowledge
  5) Remove capabilities (override only)
> 2

? What new command should the PM agent have?
Command name: create-compliance-prd

🔍 Checking for conflicts...
✅ Command 'create-compliance-prd' is unique across all agents
✅ No template conflicts detected
```

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Layer-Based Modification**: Create override files in .lcagents/custom/agents/overrides/ via LayerManager to protect core agents in .lcagents/core/
- **Safe Modification**: Use LayerManager to modify agents without touching .lcagents/core/ layer, maintaining original integrity
- **Backup System**: Implement backup functionality for .lcagents/custom/ layer changes with automatic restore capabilities
- **Agent Loading**: Use AgentLoader.loadAgent() to retrieve current agent state across .lcagents/core/, .lcagents/org/, .lcagents/custom/
- **Validation Pipeline**: Leverage AgentLoader.validateAgent() combined with LayerManager layer-aware resolution for modification validation
- **Dependency Checking**: Use ResourceResolver to validate dependencies during modification across .lcagents/{layer}/{resourceType}/
- **Rollback Support**: File system-based rollback using LayerManager patterns with automatic backup restoration to .lcagents/custom/
- **Intelligent Override Logic**: Determine when to create overrides vs. new agents based on core system protection and layer hierarchy

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Safe modification wizard preserving core functionality via layer separation
- [ ] Command add/remove interface using AgentDefinition.commands structure
- [ ] Personality and style modification via persona field updates
- [ ] Change preview system using AgentLoader parsing
- [ ] Automatic backup before changes using LayerManager
- [ ] One-click rollback capability via file system restoration
- [ ] Integration with existing agent validation pipeline

⚠️  Resource 'security-checklist.md' already exists in ORG layer!

💡 Suggested unique names:
  1) api-security-checklist ✅
  2) pm-security-checklist  
  3) security-review-checklist
> 1

✅ Name 'api-security-checklist.md' is unique across all layers
